# Module3 / Project1 / SASS

## Project Brief

Create a simple site using SASS.

## The Goal

<li>Understand what are CSS pre-processors</li>
<li>Understand what is Sass</li>
<li>Be able to create Sass code and compile it into CSS</li>
<li>Be able to "watch" files with Sass</li>

## Intro

I wanted to create a really simple website for a miniture music festival in Reykjav√≠k which I named BAR//CODE.

## The Process

I started with creating the site in <strong>Figma</strong> and I wanted it to be really responsive so I started creating the mobile version first and then the desktop version. Then I designed the logo and the barcode in <strong>Illustrator</strong> once I had my colour pallet and look that I liked. After the design was done I put everything together in <strong>VS Studio</strong>.

## The Journey

I have learned alot the last few weeks and it was really nice to see how everything works together and you are understanding more and more what you are doing. The design and HTML part came together quickly but the CSS took more time and working out how SASS works but once you got the hang of it you can see how useful it will be in the future.

## What I liked

I like how the page is really simple but there are some elements that were really hard to code like the red box around "BUY TICKET" and how the line goes "over it". I also liked both the mobile and desktop version and how it adapts to different sizes so please try to resize it and see how it goes.

## The Conclusion

I really liked using SASS because of what you can do with it and I think nesting elements make the code much more clear and easier to understand so I continue to use that in the future. The page it self was fun to design and code and I learned alot of new tricks doing it. The project was really enjoyable overall and I had good time doing it.
